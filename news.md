From Telegram:

We would like to inform you that our native token AKTIO has new USDC and BTC pairs on multiple exchanges.

Please take note of the following updates to our AKTIO token trading pairs:

-On XT.com, the AKTIO/USDT pair will be delisted on May 3. The AKTIO/USDC pair will then become the only option available.
-On Ascendex, we will introduce a new AKTIO/BTC pair, replacing the AKTIO/USDT pair starting May 3.
-On Digifinex, the AKTIO/USDT pair will be delisted on May 3 and replaced by the AKTIO/USDC pair.
-On Bitmart, the AKTIO/USDT pair will be delisted on May 10 to make way for the AKTIO/USDC pair.

These changes are not just to meet regulatory demands but also to enhance your trading experience.

### big backend upgrade

From the team on telegram:

Congratulations again to the RAYN team on this delivery!

For users, the impact isn't significant as it's primarily an overhaul of the app's wallet/vault management engine. However, it's the key release that will enable us to develop Rayn's safes and new products for the future.

Thanks to this delivery, we'll be able to build new safes based on the new RWA protocol that's coming soon, see more customisation on the safes and start building launchpad products in the coming months.

More than 4 months of work on this upgrade, well done!

And the TIER2 listings season continues! We're going to be going full steam ahead until we reach TIER1 - Everything's going smoothly, just a little longer than expected with the USDT => USDC changeover, but we'll be listed with AKTIO at the end of the course with a daily trading volume of over 2,000,000 USDC Daily... we're clearly going to change gear!

Hang on! and keep your Aktios warm!

### Impact of halving on the blochain vault

Rayn answered about the impact of the halving on the Blockchain/ Mining vault:

> No impact at rayn for now scheduled even after halving
> 
> Because we got miner machine at gross price during bear market + hosting and electricity at he best price because we pool with top 10 miner in the world + our machine are mixed between air cooling and hydro so not possible for us to be impacted by the halving only our Marge will be reduce but not the rate on vault.
> 
> Only if btc drop below 48k I could have slight impact (and below 33k but in any case it will stay above 12-% )
> 
> So you can sleep well we manage :)

also:

Cloud Mining = BTC mining production

to mine BTC you need

1/ Machine
2/ DATA CENTER (Hoster)
3/ Electricity
4/ pool of miner

1/2/3/4/ have a respective cost 

BTC Production then is impacted by

5/ Reward per block ( every time the pool complete a block you get X BTC) => Te halving will reduce the reward by block by 2
6/ Difficulty of mining
7/ Transaction revenue (Ordinal + non ordinal)

ROI (Return on investment) = Yield you earn (RAYN)

You need to do an equation including 1/2/3/4/5/6/7 and adding 8/ Price of the bitcoin to get the Return on invesment rate

So the only Hlaving (5) i snot enough to make simple conclusion on the yiled that Blcokchain vault is providing , we have enough to absorb the halving by doing less marge and keep high rate 🚁

### Staking program extended

The current `AKTIO` staking program is extended (for the nth time) to July 13th 2024
* 5% for Freedom members
* 15% for World members
* 20% for Elite members

Staking 1000 `AKTIO` currently allows to become ambassador, which allows to reduce fees and World membership costs. Ultimately, `AKTIO` is meant to provide much more utility.

### MiCA: towards USDC

USDC will be used as the main central token in Rayn. This goes in the direction of being fully [MiCA](https://www.esma.europa.eu/esmas-activities/digital-finance-and-innovation/markets-crypto-assets-regulation-mica) (`Markets in Crypto-Assets` european regulation) compliant, as there are doubts around USDT in that aspect.

Rayn confirms here its intention to adhere strictly to european regulations. It aims at being one of the first MiCA compliant institution, which will open the whole europen market and increase trust from newcomers into the project.

[Benjamin Messika](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-messika/), Head of Legal & Compliance, ran a live around the upcoming regulation changes (in french): [MiCA demystifie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlD0slyU6nk).

### AMA - Restrospective 2023
An AMA in French happened on the [Rayn X account](https://twitter.com/Rayn_app/status/1742598981622939771).

Coming back on main topics of 2023, mainly:
* Blockchain/mining vault
* French PSAN
* Deposit and withdraw Cryptos (USDT)
* Term Vault

Rayn had a turnover of 8M euros in 2023, targeting 25M euros in 2024. This is while many other companies failed due to very hard conditions with heavy bear market and crypto scandals.

They are observing high increases on social media traffic since recent TV ads and presence on various media.

2024 targets:
- increase revenues
  - increase marketing impact
  - buy-back program on the token
- increase adoption in europe
  - prepare for MICA 2025
  - FR/IT/EN marketing
- fund raising of $50M (series A)
  - 10M already promised
  - 3M already agreed from MENA
- increase token utility and review membership + ambassador status

Strategy on the token
- revamp the ambassador program to increase the token utility
- buy back
  - 10% of profit will be dedicated to buying back token. This will increase the buying pressure and thus thus the price
  - financed also bya portion of the fund raising (being discussed)
- New staking program
- cashback in AKTIO
  - limiting selling pressure by having those rewards staked
  - staking financed by buy-back
- new ambassador levels
- work on the community
- new listings after fund raising, once the commnunity will be stronger and will be able to be efficient
- there will be a rebranding of the token, but that's not major

Product roadmap
- investment and earning on crypto and classic
- traditional stock market
- blockchain vault. Initial 10M reached. Renegociated additional 5M.
  - Rayn is now a very important stakeholder for its hosting partner
  - Oman deployments with very high yield
- real asset tokenisation
  - vaults based real world asset: real estate, ...
- term vault
- institutional level research/analysis on app

6 months view:
- own decentralized protocol based on real world asset
  - vaults on thematic (real estate, socially responsible finance product)
  - IA to build fully custom vault solution, with a choice of themes, and "based on targets"
- social features:
  - send money to friends
  - shared projects/vaults
  - "cagnotte"
  - IA chat bot
  - internal chat for projects (ski trip, ...)
  - starting to think about copy trading
 
There should be a new AMA in english soon, maybe January.

## December 2023

### Term vault
December 18th: launch of the Term Vault:
* deposited money is locked for 1 year
* 7% APR
* 10% for Amabassadors until March 18th, 2024. Will be 9% after.

According to the information in-app, the vault allocation is 60% on Mimo staking and 40% on mining.

### Mining vault at 18.3%
🎉 Today on December, 8th, the mining vault interest rate bumped from 17.8% to 18.3%
