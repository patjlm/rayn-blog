### AMA - Restrospective 2023
An AMA in French happened on the [Rayn X account](https://twitter.com/Rayn_app/status/1742598981622939771).

Coming back on main topics of 2023, mainly:
* Blockchain/mining vault
* French PSAN
* Deposit and withdraw Cryptos (USDT)
* Term Vault

Rayn had a turnover of 8M euros in 2023, targeting 25M euros in 2024. This is while many other companies failed due to very hard conditions with heavy bear market and crypto scandals.

They are observing high increases on social media traffic since recent TV ads and presence on various media.

2024 targets:
- increase revenues
  - increase marketing impact
  - buy-back program on the token
- increase adoption in europe
  - prepare for MICA 2025
  - FR/IT/EN marketing
- fund raising of $50M (series A)
  - 10M already promised
  - 3M already agreed from MENA
- increase token utility and review membership + ambassador status

Strategy on the token
- revamp the ambassador program to increase the token utility
- buy back
  - 10% of profit will be dedicated to buying back token. This will increase the buying pressure and thus thus the price
  - financed also bya portion of the fund raising (being discussed)
- New staking program
- cashback in AKTIO
  - limiting selling pressure by having those rewards staked
  - staking financed by buy-back
- new ambassador levels
- work on the community
- new listings after fund raising, once the commnunity will be stronger and will be able to be efficient
- there will be a rebranding of the token, but that's not major

Product roadmap
- investment and earning on crypto and classic
- traditional stock market
- blockchain vault. Initial 10M reached. Renegociated additional 5M.
  - Rayn is now a very important stakeholder for its hosting partner
  - Oman deployments with very high yield
- real asset tokenisation
  - vaults based real world asset: real estate, ...
- term vault
- institutional level research/analysis on app

6 months view:
- own decentralized protocol based on real world asset
  - vaults on thematic (real estate, socially responsible finance product)
  - IA to build fully custom vault solution, with a choice of themes, and "based on targets"
- social features:
  - send money to friends
  - shared projects/vaults
  - "cagnotte"
  - IA chat bot
  - internal chat for projects (ski trip, ...)
  - starting to think about copy trading
 
There should be a new AMA in english soon, maybe January.
