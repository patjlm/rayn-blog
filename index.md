# History
Rayn has been founded a few years ago by a group of experts in finance, automated tradings and compliance. Especially the co-founders
* [Gael Itier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaelitier/) - CEO 
* [Jean-Yves Gillou](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jean-yves-guillou-12b58a19/) - Managing Director Europe
* [Julien Halimi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julien-halimi-45b768201/) - Chief Product Officer

It aims at revolutionizing the banking system, focusing more on earnings than on spendings. For that it uses heavily the world or crypto, not only by offering some crypto trading capabilities, but also and mostly by leveraging the new technologies behind crypto (blockchain, protocols, AI - Artificial Intelligence, ...). It brings security, compliance, performance and ease of use to the user.

# Compliance
Rayn is partnering with [ModulR Finance](https://www.modulrfinance.com/) for its banking offer (IBAN, Debit cards). It gets its standard european banking license from this partership. This is what provides the standard banking 100K guarantee on the Euro account.

Rayn is a registered finance company in Ireland, Italy and France ([PSAN](https://www.amf-france.org/fr/espace-professionnels/fintech/mes-relations-avec-lamf/obtenir-un-enregistrement-un-agrement-psan#Liste_des_PSAN_enregistrs_auprs_de_lAMF), under the name AUTOMATA FRANCE SAS).

Rayn is also getting prepared for the upcoming european MICA license as well as a license coming up in the Emirates

# Neo-bank services
Rayn offers pretty standard neo-bank services:
* Very easy setup, everything is done via theire app you can download. You'll get a direct app store (IOS / Android) once you click on my [referral link](https://rayn.money/app-referral/?referral=043144a6a9a9310624951513b931b6d73e9a49353d1969669507bee7ccbe4727) üòâ.
* You will be asked to fill a standard [KYC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer) (Know Your Customer), for compliance reasons. This is a good thing.
* Once installed and registered, you immediately have access to a personal IBAN. This allows you to transfer money to and from your new account.
* You can then select your membership, register as Ambassador, and start earning.

## Visa card
Rayn proposes different cards depending on your membership. They're all standard Visa **debit** card.

The cards allow you to pay with your EURO FIAT, but also with your crypto assets. This is done by enabling crypto payment in the app before paying. The setting is active for 15min. The merchant only sees Euros, so it works everywhere. What happens in the background is that a short-lived credit line is opened and gets reimbursed in Crypto directly. The side effect is that there is no conversion from Crypto to FIAT. In France, that should mean these transaction are not subject to the flat tax (30% of the benefits on cryptos)

The cards' limits depend on the membership. You can find the cards limit as well as other bank services info in the [membership page](https://rayn.money/memberships/).

As of today, November 6th, 2023, here are the main cards info:

# Vaults
Vault are basically saving accounts. They aim to securely earn interests. Rayn offers various types of vaults, let's describe them.

## Flex vault
[Flex vaults](https://rayn.money/flex-vault/) allow to earn interest daily on unblocked money. Much like a Livret A in France, you deposit some money on the vault and you get interests out of this money every single day after that. The big differences with the french Livret A are:
* no deposit limit
* not tax-free: you earn PAR (a crypto stable coin equal to the Euro). If you convert these PAR into Euro, you have to declare the benefit and have a flat tax on it (in France)
* interests are paid daily!
* paid interest count for the next day interests: compound interest!

Deposits can currently be made in Euro, or in USDT (a crypto stable coin aiming to be equal to USD).

Note that it may take 24 hours for your interests to take effect. So if you deposit a bit late in the day (say, after 4pm), it's possible you'll need to way 2 days to start seeing your first interests drop in.

The interest rate has been very stable for at least one year now. We currently get
* 5% APY
* ~6.5% APY for Ambassador (1000 AKTIO coins staked)

## Mining vault
Begining of 2023, Rayn launched the [Mining vault](https://rayn.money/mining-vault/). They initially had a pool of 10M USD (or Euros?) allocated to this and added twice 2M since then

In a nutshell
* they buy machines - they got very good prices during the bear market (most cryptos going down..)
* they install them in multiple locations (SRE!)
* they buy the electricity upfront at a good price. They also mentioned they use as much grren electricity as possible (solar, geothermal, ..)
* These machine are used to [mine BitCoins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_network#Mining) and get rewards, in BitCoins
* These rewards are instantly converted into PAR (Euro stable coin) and distributed to users. Rayn keeps a portion of it for themselves.

Note:
* The pool is limited. At one point, it will not be possible to deposit in mining anymore, or not at the same conditions (more expensive  machines, electricity, mining costs, rewards, ..)
* The interest rate is variable. During an AMA, they mentioned that if BTC (BitCoin) drops below 10K (which would be very very surprising), we'd still get about 10% reward for Ambassadors. The interest can also raise to more than we have today with the price of BTC raising up

Currently, Mining vaults provide 12% to non-ambassadors, and almost 17% to ambassadors, and it's been very very stable since the begining.

## Affiliates vault
Rayn has a great referral program:
* Both referree and referrer get some AKTIO (random between 10 and 200) during a succesful referral (at least 50 euros deposited on something)
* an ambassador referrer gets 5% of the fees genererated by his/her affiliates (10% with the Ambassador status üéâ). These get added to a dedicated Flex vault automatically (so you earn interests on top!)
